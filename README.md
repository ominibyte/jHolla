jHolla
======


A Skype-like, Outlook-like, or TeamViewer-like Notification box for Java

jHolla is highly flexible and can be called with a single line on code:

JHollaManager.getInstance().addNotification(JHolla.create().addMessage("Hello World!"));

Huh? so easy? Yes! that easy!

However, for more complex Notifications, it take a few more lines of code.
jHolla currently allows you to create and add as many notifications as you require and offers you the ability to programatically close the notification as well as respond to events.
